Things to do on a Windows laptop, part 2
-----------------------

The most exciting fun can be had trying to use a new Windows 10 laptop. Within hours of unboxing, browsing on the internet has become slow and unresponsive. This is because it is downloading as many Windows Updates as it can, using up all the bandwidth. Apparently it can download much more quickly from peers on the same network, however it is ignoring them and downloading directly from Microsoft.

Meanwhile, vim-fireplace needs Python dynamic. I install version 3, no luck. Looks like it needs version 2.7. YAY. Whatever omni-complete is supposed to be doing is not happening.  On the plus side, I've managed to disable the annoyingly placed up arrow when typing text, which is about as advanced as my vimming gets.
