Things to do on a Windows laptop
-----------------------

New laptop, install Vim 8 onto Win 10, and no plugins by default, unlike dear Jessie on a Chromebook chroot which just worked. So I follow June Gunn's instructions for [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and gVim works. Vim in a bash however, is complaining about plug missing, so there is some subtle path difference somewhere. Perhaps it's time to try neovim.

And the laptop has half a right shift key, with an up arrow to the left of it, which I've hit dozens of times by mistake. As a Vim user I may have to remap it.
