Things to learn:
* Phoenix - and Elixir and Erlang.
* Clojure/ClojureScript. 

The question is, if Clojure offers a platform for both client and server, then do we need to learn Phoenix? I am not sure what exists on the JVM and how it compares to the Erlang platform. 
We have the example of WhatsApp as an indicator of the high performance of Erlang. What do we have for the JVM? And for my purposes, does it matter?
